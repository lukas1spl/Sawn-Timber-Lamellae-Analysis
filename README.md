# Linking Visual Timber Quality Classification to Mechanical Properties: A Comparative Study using a Wood Defect Detection Model

This repository contains the statistical data analysis sawn timber lamellae as part of my master thesis. It contains the used R-code and datasets used for evaluating the relationship of visual quality classification and strength properties.

## Dataset

- **Tree Species:** Norway Spruce (*Picea abies*)
- **Site Description** Subalpine stands, Graub√ºnden - Switzerland
- **Sample Size:** 2'525 sawn timber lamellae sections (37 x 110 x 600 mm)
- **Data:**
  -  input datasets (post data acquisition)
  -  output datasets (post data preparation)

## Key Findings
- Density is the primary factor influence lamellae strength in the absence of (large) wood defects.
- Knots are one of the most influencical wood defects.
- Strict image-based quality classification succesfully distinguishes lamellae strength.
